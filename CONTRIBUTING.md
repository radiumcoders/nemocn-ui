### Design Principles

- **Neon First**: Components should embrace the neon aesthetic
- **shadcn/ui Compatible**: Extend existing shadcn components when possible

- **Accessible**: Maintain shadcn/ui's accessibility standards
- **Copy-Paste Friendly**: Follow shadcn's philosophy of component ownership

## Code Standards

- Use TypeScript for all components
- Follow shadcn/ui patterns and interfaces
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Maintain accessibility standards
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
